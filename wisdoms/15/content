Among them was Ladgerda, a skilled amazon, who, though a maiden, had the courage of a man.
She fought in front among the bravest with her hair loose over her shoulders.
All-marvelled at her matchless deeds, for her locks flying down her back betrayed that she was a woman.
Ladgerda, whose early love still flowed deep and steadfast, hastily sailed off with her husband and her son.
She brought herself to offer a hundred and twenty ships to the man who had once put her away.
Ladgerda, who had a matchless spirit though a delicate frame.
Covered by her splendid bravery the inclination of the soldiers to waver.
For she made a sally about, and flew round to the rear of the enemy.
Taking them unawares, and thus turned the panic of her friends into the camp of the enemy.
