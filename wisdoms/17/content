And if I only could I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
I'd be runnin' up that road Be runnin' up that hill
With no problems Say, if I only could I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places I'd be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill With no problems
Say, if I only could I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places I'd be runnin' up that road
